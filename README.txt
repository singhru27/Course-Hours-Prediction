Overview:
A series of three neural networks built using the TensorFlow library to predict average hours per week for various courses at Brown University, based off of student responses to end-of-semester questionnaires. 

Run Instructions:

Use python3 main.py RNN to run the base multichannel RNN model 

Use python3 main.py RNN_DROPOUT to run the multichannel RNN model

Use python3 main.py RNN_ALL to run the multichannel multi-input RNN model with integrated NLP processing and numerical analysis
