Many of the writers we are reading will be challenged in class -- she really tries to make people think critically about anything they read. I wish we had more class time to discuss more material, but the type of thinking developed in this class will serve people well regardless what they will be reading and learning about. There's really little I can complain about Professor Wang. I know that because she tolerates zero bullshit (except those from helpless S/NC kids who literarily do not know what they are talking about and only spoke during their final presentation for the first time), some people may find her intimidating. However, I think people need to see that it is because she has high expectations and you can do well if you push yourself. Overall, I think, for any Chinese speakers, this class is a must-take. Even if you think you know a lot about contemporary China, she dives into things people already know about with a very unique point of view that's a lot less superficial than much of the existing literature.

4,"Homework (online),Projects (group)","The course advertises itself as friendly to complete newcomers to programming. This can be true, if you figure out how to learn coding quickly enough (the trick is to google literally everything, all the time, on all assignments, without shame).

However, the course moves very quickly, and it's possible for inexperienced programmers to fall behind, so be cautious when starting the course and be prepared to study how to program in Python, in addition to studying the course materials.

Also, the projects are competitively graded, so be prepared for long nights to try and beat the curve. It can get pretty stressful.","The instructor simplifies concepts enough for newcomers to understand them without being bogged down in technical jargon or complicated math/logic. Additionally, the instructor uses humor and cool real-world examples to complement the material, which helps students process what they're learning.

All in all, this class is highly informative and entertaining, even if you don't know how to program at the beginning. Additionally, the coding complexity starts off very simple and slowly ramps up throughout the semester, with extra credit homework designed to help newcomers learn as they go. It's basically a combination Python coding/AI class.

However, grades are very heavily weighted towards a small number of assignments that have competitive elements. Some groups on these projects are guaranteed a worse grade as a result, no matter how well they do, and since the projects are worth so much of the final grade, this can be a very real problem.

I am not writing this out of any reason to do with disappointment in grades or otherwise. I studied and worked hard for this course, but was so extremely disappointed with Chi-Ming Hai's teaching this semester. I have been at Brown for two years and experienced many professors, and I have had both positive and not quite as positive experiences, but all professors made an effort to help students, engage the class, and present the material in an interesting way. Chi-Ming Hai did not one of these aforementioned things and present the course material in the most boring possible way possible. Mr. Hai, I implore you to consider the merits of rote memorization: I came to Brown and wanted to learn Physiology to apply my knowledge, but instead you write a textbook that you want us to memorize word-for-word and the exams test us on the most obscure points. This is not conducive to my learning at all. Furthermore, your lectures were more dry than anything I have ever experienced in my life. I attended each one and asked you questions, which you could barely answer. When we transitioned online, all you did was send us PowerPoints with voice recordings and did not even hold virtual office hours. Seriously, could you not have considered being a bit more helpful to all of the students in these times? 
I do not have many regrets in my life, but taking your course is one of them. The fall semester course sounds so much more interesting with Prof. Stein because he encourages students to apply the knowledge acquired. I hope that you can take some of this and perhaps design the course in a slightly more interesting way because I do not want other students to suffer through this rote memorization and boring teaching style as I did.

In response to student stress and how much we were struggling, the instructors decided to cancel the midterm and one of the remaining projects, delay the second project's due date by a whole month, and change the final exam into a take-home style, all to help students be less stressed.
All this is to say, the instructors and TAs were responsive to students' needs in the crisis at a level beyond anything I could possibly have expected.

-Handling of student questions: Prof. Tan rarely stopped for questions, and when he did, he sometimes accidentally interrupted and/or blew right past the students' questions. 
-Lecture: Prof. Tan would often cover topics or go through examples as if giving a brief overview to someone who'd seen the material before and just needed a refresher.
